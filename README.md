Nmp - Node Package Manager

    a. it is the commonly used 'app store' for node applications, made for and by JS developers

    b. it is also a command line utility used to download and install packages (from the web of node devs). any developer can upload packages they've created



Commands in order;

nmp init
        //creates a package.json 
        //which contains all of the METADATA related to your project
        //metadata - is the dna information about your project 
        // metadata is data about data
git init

git add -A vs. git add .

    -A adds all files in all directories of your repo
    . adds the files CURRENT DIRECTORY and you must specify the file name if you want just one file to be added to files that will be in the commit


git status //on branch master
git branch  //* master
